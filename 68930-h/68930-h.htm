The first of a remarkable series of underworld stories by the author of
“Thirst” and “The Harvest of the Deep.” Few other writers have Mr. Leverage’s
keen sense of drama and ability to describe swift action clearly.</p>

<p>Chester Fay, a slender, keen-eyed, gray-haired young man,—clad in prison
shoddy, serving life and fifteen years at Rockglen,—glanced through the rain
and over the wall to where a green-cloaked hill loomed. “Charley,” he
whispered, “we might as well try it this afternoon. Are you game?” Charley
O’Mara, sixty-five years old, bent, broken, and bitter at the law, coughed a
warning. He raised his pick and started digging around a flower-bed.</p>

<p>A guard in a heavy raincoat, carrying a dripping rifle, came toward the two
prisoners. He stopped a few feet away from Fay.</p>

<p>“Quit that talkin’!” he snarled. “I’ll chalk you in if I see any more of
it!”</p>

<p>Fay did not answer the guard. He spaded the earth, dug deep, tossed the
shovelfuls to one side and waited until the guard had strolled within the
shelter of a low shed.</p>

<p>“Charley!” he continued without moving his lips. “Listen, old pal. See that
motortruck near the shed?”</p>

<p>“I see it, Chester.”</p>

<p>“See where the screw is standing?”</p>

<p>“He’s watching us.”</p>

<p>“And I’m watching him, Charley. We can beat this stir in an hour. Do you
want to try it?”</p>

<p>“How you going to do it?”</p>

<p>“Will you follow me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, pal.”</p>

<p>“Wait till it gets a little darker. Then we’ll take the chance.”</p>

<p>The prison guard stood with his rifle lowered to the moist earth beneath
the shed. His eyes ranged from the two convicts to the wall upon which were
other guards sheltered in tiny guardhouses. He yawned and drowsed,
standing.</p>

<p>Fay worked in a slow circle. He had seen the auto-truck come into the
prison yard at noon. It was part of the road-gang’s outfit. There was no
road-work that day, on account of the rain. The inmate driver had gone into
the cellhouse.</p>

<p>Old Charley O’Mara let his pick dig into the earth with feeble strokes. He
paused at times. There was that to Fay’s actions which presaged much. The
gray-haired young man was gradually closing in on the drowsing guard. He was
like a lean panther getting ready for a spring.</p>

<hr style='border:none; color:inherit; margin-top:1em;' />

<p>The attack came with lightninglike suddenness. Fay dropped his shovel,
crossed the earth, struck the guard a short-arm uppercut and bore him down to
earth, where he smothered his cries with a flap of the raincoat.</p>

<p>Charley O’Mara came limping toward the shed.</p>

<p>“Get a rope!” snapped Fay. “I don’t want to croak him.”</p>

<p>“Croakin’s too good for the likes of him, Chester.”</p>

<p>“Get a rope. We’ve got about fifteen minutes to work in. We ought to be
beyond the wall by then.”</p>

<p>Fay worked quickly. He took the rope the old convict found, and trussed the
guard, after taking off the raincoat. He made sure that the man would make no
outcry. He fastened a stick in his mouth and tied it behind his head. He rose
and glanced through the down-pouring rain.</p>

<p>“I knocked him out,” he said. “Now, Charley, put on that raincoat, take the
cap and rifle and walk slowly toward the auto-truck. Get in the front. Stand
up like a guard.”</p>

<p>“But they might know me!”</p>

<p>“They wont know you. It’s raining. The screws on the wall will think you
are taking the truck out, by order of the warden. I’ll drive. An inmate always
drives.”</p>

<p>The guard who sat huddled in the little house which loomed over the great
gate at Rockglen rose, opened a small window and glanced out as he heard the
motortruck mounting the grade from the prison yard. He saw what he thought was
the figure of a guard standing by a convict. The convict crouched with partly
hidden face over the steering-wheel.</p>

<p>“All right!” shouted Charley O’Mara, motioning with his rifle toward the
closed gate.</p>

<p>The guard squinted for a second time. He caught, through the rain, the
gleam of brass on the cap Charley wore. He saw the rifle. He reached and
pulled at a lever. The gate slowly opened, first to a crack, then wide. Fay
pressed forward the clutch pedal, shifted from neutral to first speed, stepped
on the accelerator and let the clutch pedal up gently.</p>

<p>The truck mounted the top of the grade, churned through the gate, turned in
front of the warden’s house and took the incline which led over the hill from
Rockglen.</p>

<hr style='border:none; color:inherit; margin-top:1em;' />

<p>All might have gone well for the convicts had it not been for the rain.
Water had formed in deep pools along the road. Into these pools Fay guided the
clumsy truck. He heard the engine miss an explosion. A sputter followed. The
truck slowed. An explosion sounded in the muffler. The insulation wires
grounded and short-circuited. The truck stopped.</p>

<p>Fay sprang from the driver’s seat and opened the hood. He attempted to find
the trouble. A dangling wire, touching the engine’s frame, was sodden with
water.</p>

<p>“No go!” he said to Charley. “Come on! We’ll leave the truck and take to
the woods. That means a chase as soon as the big whistle blows.”</p>

<p>The two convicts were crossing an open field when they heard the first
menacing blasts from the prison siren. They ran for shelter. A dog barked. A
farmhand came through the underbrush. He stood watching.</p>

<p>“Keep your nerve!” said Fay. “You’ve got the rifle. Night is coming on.
Follow me.”</p>

<p>The trail led away from Rockglen. Fay sensed the general direction. He
attempted to gain a railroad junction where a freight could be taken for
Chicago. He was headed off by a motorcar load of prison guards. He saw the
danger in time.</p>

<p>“To the right,” he whispered to O’Mara. “Follow me. Don’t cave, pal.”</p>

<p>“I’m all in,” sobbed the old convict.</p>

<p>Fay braced his arm beneath Charlie’s elbow. He took the rifle. They crossed
a swollen brook, broke through the hedge of a vast estate and came suddenly
upon a trio of watchmen who had been alarmed by the blowing of the prison’s
siren.</p>

<p>The fight that followed was entirely onesided. Fay pumped lead in the
general direction of the watchmen. He was answered by a salvo. Crimson cones
splashed the night. Bullets whined. A shout sounded far away. Other watchmen
and constables were surrounding the estate.</p>

<p>Old Charley O’Mara, crouching in the shelter of a hawthorn clump, coughed,
rose, spun and fell face downward. A great spot of scarlet ran over the
raincoat. His aged face twisted in agony. Fay knelt by his side.</p>

<p>“I’m croaked, pal,” said the convict. “They winged me through the lungs.
Good-by, pal.”</p>

<p>“Anything I can do, Charley?”</p>

<p>“Do you think you’ll get away?”</p>

<p>“I know I will.”</p>

<p>“To Chi?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“Will you go see my little girl?”</p>

<p>“Where is she?”</p>

<p>“At the Dropper’s, on Harrison Street. She’s in bad, Chester. Take her away
from them low-brows.”</p>

<p>“How old is she?”</p>

<p>“Sixteen.”</p>

<p>“What is her name?”</p>

<p>“Emily—little Emily.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of her, Charley. I promise you that!”</p>

<hr style='border:none; color:inherit; margin-top:1em;' />

<p>Fay let the convict’s head drop to the ground. He heard the death-rattle.
He kicked aside the empty and useless rifle.</p>

<p>The way of escape was not an easy one. Forms moved in the mist. He darted
for a row of bushes. He crawled beneath them. He gained the high fence around
the estate, where, freed of the necessity of setting his pace to that of the
old convict, he broke through the far-flung cordon of guards and watchmen and
gained a woods which extended north and west for over a score of miles.</p>

<p>He discovered, toward morning, a small house in course of erection. Its
scaffolding stood gaunt against the velvet of the sky. A carpenter’s chest
rested on the back porch.</p>

<p>Fay pried this open with a hatchet, removed a suit of overalls and a saw,
and dropped the lid. He emerged from the woods, looking for all the world like
a carpenter going to work.</p>

<p>To the man who had wolfed the world—to the third cracksman then
living—the remainder of his get-away to Chicago was a journey wherein each
detail fitted in with the others.</p>

<p>He arrived—after riding in gondola-cars, hugging the tops of Pullmans and
helping stoke an Atlantic type locomotive—at the first fringe of the city of
many millions.</p>

<p>With sharp eyes before him, and dodging police-haunted streets, he mingled
with the workers—seemingly a carpenter.</p>

<p>No one of all the throng seemed to notice him. He walked slowly at times.
He thought of old Charley O’Mara, and of the dying convict’s request.</p>

<p>A speck in the yeast, a chip on the foam, he quickened his steps and
entered a small pawnshop where money could be borrowed for enterprises of a
shady nature.</p>

<hr style='border:none; color:inherit; margin-top:1em;' />

<p>Mother Madlebaum peered over the counter at the gray-haired young man who
held out an empty palm and asked for a loan on a mythical watch. She removed
her spectacles, polished them with her black alpaca apron, and glanced
shrewdly toward the door.</p>

<p>“What a start you gave me, Chester. And me thinking all along you were
lagged.”</p>

<p>“Five C’s on the block,” laughed Fay pleasantly. “Remember the blue-white
gems I brought you last time? Remember the swag, loot and plunder from the
Hanover job? You made big on them.”</p>

<p>“I always do with your stuff, Chester.”</p>

<p>“Can you lend me five hundred? I’ve just beaten stir.”</p>

<p>The old fence opened her safe and brought forth a money-drawer. Fay took
the bills she handed to him, without counting them. He touched his hat and
started toward the door.</p>

<p>“Wait, Chester.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Want to plant upstairs till the blow is over?”</p>

<p>“No. I promised old Charley O’Mara I’d see his girl for him. Poor Charley
is dead.”</p>

<p>“He wasn’t in your class, Chester. Nobody is.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the Dropper’s scatter?”</p>

<p>“Five doors from the corner, on Harrison Street. Is the girl there?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then may God help her. You can’t!”</p>

<p>Fay passed from the fence and lost himself in the clothing-department of a
dry-goods store. He entered the place a carpenter—down in the heels and
somewhat grimy from his train-ride. He emerged with a bamboo cane hooked over
the sleeve of a shepherd-plaid suit. His hat was a flat-brimmed Panama, his
shoes correct.</p>

<p>A bath, shave, shampoo and haircut completed his metamorphosis. He left a
barber-shop—the proper figure of a young man. He walked briskly, seeing
everything.</p>

<hr style='border:none; color:inherit; margin-top:1em;' />

<p>There were detectives in that city—discerning ones. He avoided the main
streets and crossings. Wolf-keen and alert for the police, he turned toward
the dive where little Emily O’Mara lived. He distrusted the place and cursed
himself for the venture.</p>

<p>The Dropper’s reputation among the powers that preyed was—unsavory. There
had been rumors in the old days that he was a pigeon. The den and joint he
managed sheltered cheap dips, pennyweighters and store-histers who bragged of
their miserable exploits.</p>

<p>Fay entered the hallway that led up to the Dropper’s, like a duke paying a
visit to a tenement.</p>

<p>A gas-light flared the second landing. An ash-can, half filled with empty
bottles, marked the third. Fay paused by this can, studied a fist-banged door,
then knocked with light knuckles.</p>

<p>As he waited for a chain to be unhooked and a slide to open, he sniffed the
air of the hallway. Somewhere, some one was smoking opium.</p>

<p>A brutish, shelving-browed, scar-crossed face appeared at the opening.
Steely eyes drilled toward the cracksman.</p>

<p>“What d’ye want here?”</p>

<p style='font-style:italic'>“Gee sip en quessen, hop en yen?”</p>

<p>“Who to hell are yuh?”</p>

<p>“A friend,” said Fay. “A man to see Charley O’Mara’s daughter.”</p>

<p>Fay carried no revolver. He scorned such things. The police rated him too
clever to commit murder. Only amateurs and coke-fiends did things like
that.</p>

<p>He wished, however, that he could thrust the blued-steel muzzle of a gat
through the panel and order the Dropper to unlatch the door. The thug was so
long in making up his none-too-alert mind.</p>

<p>It swung finally. Fay stepped into the room. He narrowed his eyes and
mentally photographed a mean den, made translucent by the greenish-hued smoke
that swirled over a peanut-oil lamp and floated before the drawn faces of many
poppy-dreamers who were peering from bunks.</p>

<p>The Dropper stood waiting. His elbows were slightly bent. His huge,
broken-boned hands came slowly in front. He measured Fay from the tip of the
shoes to the prematurely gray hair that showed beneath the cracksman’s straw
hat.</p>

<p>“Well, when did you get out of stir?” he snarled with sudden recognition.
“I thought they threw the key away on yuh.”</p>

<p>“Easy, Dropper! Who are all these people?”</p>

<p>“Aw, they’re all right! There’s Canada Mac and Glycerine Jimmy an’ three
broads over there. Then there’s Mike the Bike and Micky Gleason with us
to-night. Know them?”</p>

<p>Fay unhooked his cane from his arm. He swung it back and forth as he
studied the faces in the bunks. His stare dropped to the peanut-oil lamp and
the lay-out tray around which reclined two smokers. He saw a piglike dog
crouching by a screen. Behind this was the entrance to another room.</p>

<p>“Suppose we go in there,” he said. “There’s something I want to speak to
you about, Dropper.”</p>

<p>“Spit it out, here!”</p>

<p>“No!” Fay’s voice took on a metallic incisiveness. He flashed a warning at
the Dropper. The big man shifted his eyes uneasily, and followed Fay around
the screen and into a room where two chintz-covered windows looked out into
Harrison Street. There were a poker-table, a couch and many chairs in the
room. The floor was covered with a cheap matting.</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Fay, still swinging his cane: “I came here to see Charley
O’Mara’s daughter. I want to see her quick! I can’t stay around here. It’s no
place—”</p>

<p>“Aw, cut that kid-glove stuff. What d’ye think we are—stools?”</p>

<p>“I want to see Charley’s daughter—Emily!”</p>

<p>“You can’t!”</p>

<p>“What have you done with her?”</p>

<p>“I aint done nothin’. She lives right here.”</p>

<p>Fay hung his cane on a chair, removed his hat, turned, backed against the
poker-table and fastened upon the Dropper a glance of white fire.</p>

<p>“Tell that girl to come to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, who the hell are you orderin’ around?”</p>

<p>“Go! Get—that—girl!”</p>

<p>The Dropper was in his own castle. The bunks in the den were filled with
the reclining forms of a number of men who would commit murder at his bidding.
He had, safely planted, the only hundred toys of choice Victoria hop in all of
Chicago. One could buy most anything, from virtue to a man’s soul, with opium
at the current prices.</p>

<p>He considered the matter of Fay with a slow brain. Back in the heart of him
there lurked a fear for a five-figure man. They did big things. They were
supercrooks. Their weight might be felt through political influence.</p>

<p>“I’m hep!” he said sullenly. “You want to cop the skirt from me. You want
to tell her about diamonds and rubies and strings of pearls—of swag and kale
and the easy life swillin’ wine.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to do anything of the kind. I’ve got a message for her from
her old man. He’s not well,” Fay added cautiously, remembering that under the
law the Dropper might be considered Emily’s guardian.</p>

<p>“So he aint goin’ to get sprung? I heard he had a swell mouthpiece who was
workin’ with the pollies.”</p>

<p>“The appeal was denied last week. The governor turned it down—cold.
Charley may have to serve his full term.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, if that’s the straight of it— I’ll get the moll an’ let you
chin with her a bit. Remember, no fancy stuff.”</p>

<p>Fay stared at the dive-keeper disgustedly. The Dropper weighed over two
hundred and fifty pounds. He moved his gross form across the matting, paused
at the screen where the piglike dog lay, and lumbered out of sight. His voice
rasped in a shout: “Emily!”</p>

<hr style='border:none; color:inherit; margin-top:1em;' />

<p>Her entrance came a minute after Fay had seated himself at the
poker-table. His hand rested on his hat. He heard the Dropper’s nagging
oaths.</p>

<p>Emily entered, propelled by a strong arm.</p>

<p>Fay rose. He flashed an assuring glance. He reached and offered her a
chair.</p>

<p>The picture she left with him, as he turned for the chair, was one he could
never forget.</p>

<p>Golden-glossed hair, fine-spun as flax, an oval face, big sherry-colored
eyes, long lashes, a round breast and straight figure—was his summing up of
little Emily O’Mara.</p>

<p>The Dropper lunged for the girl. He lifted her chin. He leered as she
cringed from him.</p>

<p>“This guy wants to see you, kid!”</p>

<p>Fay pressed the sides of his trousers with the sensitive tips of his
fingers. He waited, with his teeth grinding. He wanted to leap the distance,
reach, clutch and throttle the purple neck of the brute.</p>

<p>The Dropper swung a terrible jaw and eyed Fay.</p>

<p>“Go to it!” he rumbled. “Get done with the kid, damn quick. Tell her
she’ll never see her old man again. That’s wot I’ve been tellin’ her—all the
time.”</p>

<p>Fay waited until the Dropper disappeared. He moved the chair he had offered
to the girl, so that she could see it.</p>

<p>“Wont you sit down, Emily? I left your dad last night. He wasn’t well.”</p>

<p>A flash of interest and gratitude crossed her features. She clutched her
skirt, stared at the door, bent one knee and sank into the chair timidly.</p>

<p>Fay leaned and whispered:</p>

<p>“Your father sent me to you. He wants you to leave this bunch. He’s afraid
you are not being well treated. He thinks you ought to go to some good home,”
he added as he realized the girl’s underworld upbringing.</p>

<p>“Is Father coming back to me?”</p>

<p>“No, never.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>The naivete of the question struck Fay as an indictment against society.</p>

<p>“Because the laws are unjust!” he declared. “They keep a man in prison
after he is reformed. They don’t keep a man in a hospital after he is
cured.”</p>

<p>“Did you escape from Rockglen?”</p>

<p>“Would it make any difference to you if I had broken out of prison?”</p>

<p>“No, it wouldn’t make any difference to me—but I don’t know what you
mean.”</p>

<p>“I mean I want you to go away with me. I want to get you out of this den of
petty-larceny addicts and low-brows. That’s what your father wanted,
Emily.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t even know your name. Why should I run away with you?”</p>

<p>“Because the Dropper is a brute. Because he will beat you—if he hasn’t
already. Because the life here leads to the gutter—and mighty fast you’ll
drift down to it, little Emily.”</p>

<hr style='border:none; color:inherit; margin-top:1em;' />

<p>The girl arranged a black velvet bandeau on her hair. Fay noticed that the
rings on her fingers were brassy and childish. They grated on a man who had
never handled any but first-water jewels.</p>

<p>He leaned forward and suggested:</p>

<p>“Come with me—say, to-morrow night. We’ll go East together. I know a
motherly woman who has an old mansion on the Hudson.”</p>

<p>Little Emily fluttered her lashes in an anxious glance at the open door,
beyond which was the sound of dreamy voices.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“He wont let me.”</p>

<p>“What is he to you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, but I’m afraid of him. He’s so strong.”</p>

<p>“He’s a big mush, little Emily—a woman-beater, a peddler of opium—a Fink,
if you know what that means.”</p>

<p>The girl pulled her dress down to the tops of her broken shoes. She
twisted, glanced up, smiled faintly, and blanched as the Dropper thrust his
head into the room.</p>

<p>“What are you tryin’ to pull off?” he asked.</p>

<p>Fay stared over the girl’s cringing shoulder. His steel-blue eyes locked
with the brute’s. They burned and blazed into a sodden brain. The Dropper
leered, said, “Oh, all right, cul,” and went back to the smokers around the
lay-out tray.</p>

<p>“Quick, Emily! Make up your mind. Can I come for you to-morrow night? I owe
it to your old man. We’ll go East, and this woman I know will take care of
you. I hate the coppers, and I’m out to collect from the world. They sent me
away to Rockglen—dead, bang wrong! They gave me life and fifteen years. I
didn’t serve fifteen weeks!”</p>

<p>Fay ceased pleading. He watched the girl. There was a mark behind her left
ear which could only have come from a blow. She fingered a black velvet
bandeau. She clenched her hands. She started to rise. Suddenly she dropped to
the chair.</p>

<p>“I can’t go—even if Dad wants me to. I can’t leave the Dropper. I am
afraid he’ll kill me if I go away with you.”</p>

<p>“He’s got you cowed!”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it.”</p>

<p>“And you slave for him—work for him—touch his hand when he calls for
you?”</p>

<p>“I do. You don’t understand my position.”</p>

<p>“It’s an outrage. Poor Charley O’Mara’s daughter held in the clutches of
that beast!”</p>

<p>“He is going to kill me some day. I saw him kill a man once. He hit him
with his fist. They carried the man to the river.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I come here to-morrow night with a gat, stick up the joint, make
the Dropper whine like a cur. What would you do?”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t whine. He’d kill you—the way he killed that man who didn’t
pay him for a card of hop.”</p>

<p>Fay caught the underworld note.</p>

<p>“Do you smoke?” His voice was suspicious.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t smoke opium. I watch other people do that.”</p>

<p>“You’re too sensible. Does the Dropper smoke?”</p>

<p>“He don’t smoke, either. He sells the stuff.”</p>

<hr style='border:none; color:inherit; margin-top:1em;' />

<p>The girl’s naïveté brought a smile to Fay’s lips.</p>

<p>“You’re going East,” he said. “I’ll make the money for your education. I’ve
got two big jobs located. One is in Maiden Lane.”</p>

<p>“Diamonds?”</p>

<p>“Yes, gems. What do you say, little Emily?”</p>

<p>“I—I am afraid.”</p>

<p>“But think what a beautiful world this is. There is London and Paris and
Rome.”</p>

<p>“London and Paris and Rome mean nothing to me. I wouldn’t know how to
behave in those places. All I’ve known is Harrison Street, and the back rooms
of saloons, and getting beat up.”</p>

<p>“But your dad was a high-roller.”</p>

<p>“He wasn’t always. Sometimes he was broke. Sometimes we didn’t know where
we were going to get things to eat.”</p>

<p>Fay’s voice grew tender.</p>

<p>“Emily,” he said, “that’s all a bad dream. Yesterday afternoon I made a
get-away. A man who was dying—a mark for the prison screws—told me to go and
save his daughter. I don’t want you to think I forgot that request. I could
never forget it. Charley was a pal o’ mine. I came right to you. I see the
lay-out. You’re cowed, beaten, crushed, by the Dropper. I’ll croak him when
you ask me to.”</p>

<p>“You can’t! I want you to go away. Please don’t suggest anything like that.
I like you, but I can never run away with you. I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“Good God, do you want me to leave you in this joint?”</p>

<p>“It’s the only life I’ve ever known.”</p>

<p>“Where do you sleep?”</p>

<p>“On a cot upstairs.”</p>

<p>“And you ought to have a palace. Did you ever look at yourself in the
glass?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes, after he beats me.”</p>

<p>Fay started toward the door. He heard a chair upset. Little Emily dragged
on his arm.</p>

<p>“Don’t go to him! He’ll kill you.”</p>

<p>“Then you come with me.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid to.”</p>

<p>The girl spoke the truth. Her color was ashen.</p>

<p>Fay went to the table, lifted her chair, turned it and motioned for her to
sit down. She hesitated between the table and door.</p>

<p>“Please,” said Fay.</p>

<p>He might have been addressing a princess. Her color returned in rippling
waves. She tried to smile. Her lips trembled—she took one step in his
direction, swayed, and pressed her fists to her breast.</p>

<p>The Dropper’s form completely filled the doorway.</p>

<p>“Come here!” he snarled.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” snapped Fay.</p>

<p>“Come ’ere, yuh!”</p>

<p>The girl between the two men, made her choice, or rather, had it made for
her.</p>

<p>Shrinkingly demure, and altogether tearful, she pressed by the Dropper and
glided across the den where the poppy-smokers lay.</p>

<p>“Go to bed!”</p>

<p>Fay saw the brute’s chin move in a slow circle over his shelving shoulder.
He swung back his jaw.</p>

<p>“You’re next,” he said. “Better beat it, bo. I’ll tame yuh like I’ve tamed
her.”</p>

<p>“Tamed is good.” Fay picked up his hat. He hooked the cane over his left
sleeve. “Rather pleasant evening, Dropper.... I see you understand women.”</p>

<p>“I guess I do. Yuh want to let ’em know you’re the biggest guy alive. I’m
that guy. Nobody ever took a broad away from me.”</p>

<p>“But she’s only a kid, Dropper.”</p>

<p>“Another year—”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re right. Well, so long. There’ll be another night, too. I’m
coming back.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be ready for yuh!”</p>

<hr style='border:none; color:inherit; margin-top:1em;' />

<p>Fay had no set plan as he left the scatter of Mike Cregan—alias the
Dropper. He wanted to thrash out the matter of Emily O’Mara in his mind. Her
behavior, and the fear she held of her unsavory guardian, puzzled the
cracksman.</p>

<p>He had accomplished much in a brief time. There were not many men living
who could have broken out of Rockglen on one afternoon and strolled down
Michigan Avenue the next. It was an exploit in keeping with his
reputation.</p>

<p>Midnight found him working over the problem of the girl. He recalled old
Charley’s last instructions:</p>

<p>“Get her away from the low-brows.”</p>

<p>A promise, Fay had never intentionally broken. There was the girl—naive,
doll-like, docile. There was the Dropper—demanding, brutish, a fink.</p>

<p>Fay slept that night at a stag hotel.</p>

<p>He woke early, bathed beneath a shower, dressed and went down to
breakfast.</p>

<p>On Harrison Street he gulped the air. He avoided being seen by the
detectives of the city. Once he took a cab for a distance of five squares. He
dismissed the driver at the side entrance of a cheap hotel—sauntered through
the lobby and emerged with a sharp glance to left and right.</p>

<p>The game gripped him as he dodged into the tenement and started climbing
the gas-flared stairways to the hop-joint. He knew, in the soul of him, that
Chicago was a danger-spot.</p>

<p>He knocked on the door and was admitted by the Dropper—who seemed
alone.</p>

<p>“Back again,” said Fay. “I said I’d be back. Where is Emily?”</p>

<p>“Wot t’hell!”</p>

<p>“Where is the girl?”</p>

<p>A gliding sounded over the matting of the room beyond the screen. Emily
thrust her head through the doorway. Her sherry-colored eyes were red-rimmed,
glazed with tears, sullen. The Dropper had just finished his morning hate by
upbraiding her.</p>

<p>“Wot t’hell’s comin’ off?” rumbled the dive-keeper. “Beat it, cul, before
I wake up. I’m going to wham yuh one.”</p>

<p>Fay swiftly hooked his cane over the edge of an empty bunk, removed his
hat, took off his coat, and rolled up his sleeves.</p>

<p>“I didn’t bring a gat!” he snapped. “I don’t need one. Get into that room,
set the card-table back and pile up the chairs. Get ready, you fink, for
what’s coming to you.”</p>

<hr style='border:none; color:inherit; margin-top:1em;' />

<p>The Dropper found himself in the grip of a situation not exactly to his
liking. He backed from Fay. He crashed over the screen. He turned, thrust
Emily aside, and shelved forward his shoulders in an aggressive posture. His
brows worked up and down. The scar on his cheek grew livid.</p>

<p>“Hol’ on,” he started to protest.</p>

<p>Fay stepped swiftly forward, whipped over a lightning uppercut, and jabbed
with his left fist toward the brute’s stomach. Both blows had force enough to
land the Dropper against the card-table.</p>

<p>He went down like a pole-axed bullock. He rose in his might and rage. His
bellowing could have been heard a block away. He came at Fay unskillfully—thrown
off balance by the sudden attack.</p>

<p>The clean life of a supercrook stood Fay in good stead. His weight was less
than half that of the Dropper’s. But he more than made up for this by the
swiftness of his blows. He tormented the brute by jabs, hooks and
side-stepping.</p>

<p>The Dropper was no novice at boxing. Once, years before, he had been Honest
Abe’s chief bouncer. He had broken men’s heads and hurled derelicts from
barrooms. He knew the rudiments of wrestling.</p>

<p>Slowly his thick brain came into action. He covered his jaw with a shelving
shoulder. He put down his bulletlike head and started to bore through the rain
of blows. With wild swings he forced Fay against the poker-table. It went over
and rolled to the wall near where Emily crouched.</p>

<p>The cracksman glided around the Dropper and shadow-tormented him. He struck
straight from the shoulder. He was two-fisted and agile. Each flash of his eye
was marked by a stinging blow. A crescendo of effort, all to the brute’s
purple face, had its effect. The Dropper started gasping. He lowered his
fists. He breathed, waiting. He grunted as he followed Fay—blindly, grossly.
A red gleam showed where his lids were puffing.</p>

<hr style='border:none; color:inherit; margin-top:1em;' />

<p>Fay felt his own strength waning. He called on all his latent nerve-force.
He became a tiger. He leaped, drove a smashing fist between the Dropper’s
gorilla-like brows, stepped back, dodged a swing, then repeated the blow. He
played for this mark. The fury of his assault was like an air-hammer on a
rivet. It deadened the brute’s brain. It made him all animal.</p>

<p>A bull’s roar filled the room. Goaded to an open defense, the Dropper
abandoned science. He tried to grasp his tormentor. His huge hands groped
through the air. He stumbled and searched. He fell over a chair. He rose to
his knees. Fay waited, hooked a short, elbow-jab between the eyes. He followed
with his left. His arm snapped in its sting. He backed, side-stepped, and
started around the Dropper, delivering blows like a cooper finishing a
barrel.</p>

<p>A red rage came to the cracksman that was terrible in its ferocity. He
forgot Emily. He saw only the swollen thing before him. He wanted to kill. He
sought for the opening.</p>

<p>Abandoning his straight jabs, he danced in and out with short-arm swings to
the face and neck and eyes. He pounded the ears until they resembled
cauliflowers. He made a pulp of the Dropper’s face.</p>

<p>The end came in less than a second. Beaten into near-insensibility,
tottering and bloated—the Dropper attempted to reach the door that led to the
opium-joint. He remembered a gat he had planted there. He lowered his
shielding left shoulder. His jaw was exposed.</p>

<p>Fay poised on tiptoes, drew back his right fist and sent it home with the
tendons of his legs strained in the effort. His weight, his rage, his science
and clean living were in that blow. It milled the brute, staggered and brought
him crashing, first to his knees, then over on his back, where he lay with his
swollen face turned toward the ceiling.</p>

<p>Little Emily glided to the door. She waited with her eyes fixed and
shimmering.</p>

<p>Fay breathed deeply. He turned, unrolled his silk sleeves and said:</p>

<p>“Will—you—get my hat and coat and cane, please?”</p>

<p>Little Emily helped him on with his coat. Her hands trembled.</p>

<p>“Now get <i>your</i> things. You’re going away from here.”</p>

<p>She returned within three minutes.</p>

<p>“I’m ready,” she said.</p>

<p>“You saw me knock him out?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Go look at him.”</p>

<p>Emily hurried into the room. She knelt by the Dropper’s head. She came back
to Fay and whispered:</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of him any more.”</p>

<p>“Why, little Emily?”</p>

<p>“Because you are stronger than he is.”</p>

<p>Fay opened the door that led to the hallway where the gas-flare showed in
the gloom.</p>

<p>“Have you everything?” he asked.</p>

<p>Emily pointed to a pasteboard hatbox. Fay lifted it gallantly.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he said.</p>

<p>“Where are you going to take me?” she asked, humbly.</p>

<p>“I’m going to take you to the house of the good woman on the Hudson.”</p>

<p>“And what are <i>you</i> going to do?”</p>

<p>“I? I’m going to get word to Charley O’Mara that I kept my promise—and his
kid’s all right.”</p>
